## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔤 Python Basics
- Variables, Data Types, Type Casting
- Operators: Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise
- Input/Output, String Formatting
- If/Else, Loops (for, while)
- Comprehensions (List, Dict, Set)

### 🧰 Data Structures & Built-ins
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Stacks, Queues (with `collections`)
- Iterators and Generators
- `range`, `enumerate`, `zip`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- `lambda` functions

### 📦 Modules and Packages
- Importing modules
- Creating your own modules and packages
- `__init__.py`, `__main__`
- Using `pip`, virtual environments

### 🧪 Functions
- Defining and calling functions
- Arguments: positional, keyword, default, *args, **kwargs
- Recursion
- Closures, Decorators

### 🔁 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- Classes and Objects
- Attributes, Methods
- Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism
- Dunder (Magic) Methods
- Class vs Static Methods

### 🚫 Error Handling
- Try/Except Blocks
- Finally, Else
- Raising Exceptions
- Custom Exceptions

### 🧪 File Handling & OS Interaction
- Reading/Writing files
- `os`, `pathlib`, `shutil`
- Working with directories and paths

### ⏱️ Time, Date, and Performance
- `datetime`, `calendar`, `time`
- `timeit` for benchmarking
- Memory & Performance Profiling

### 🧪 Testing & Debugging
- `assert`, `unittest`, `pytest`
- Debugging with `pdb`

### 📄 Advanced Topics
- Context Managers (`with`)
- Functional Programming Patterns
- Decorators & Generators Internals
- Type Hints (PEP 484)
- Introspection & Metaprogramming
- Multithreading vs Multiprocessing
- AsyncIO (event loop, coroutines, await/async)

## 🛠️ Applied Python for DS/ML
- NumPy Essentials
- Pandas: DataFrames, Series, Aggregation
- Matplotlib/Seaborn Basics
- Working with CSVs, JSONs, APIs

## 🗂 Folder Structure

- `notes/`  
  📝 Python theory, cheatsheets, handwritten notes, syntax guides.

- `projects/`  
  🧪 Colab-based hands-on notebooks: file handling, object-oriented practice, DS/ML preprocessing tools.

- `diagrams/`  
  🎨 OOP diagrams, Python memory model, Python internals (interpreters, stacks, GIL) — via draw.io or Manim.

## 🔮 Suggested Projects
- Build a calculator CLI
- File explorer CLI tool using `os` and `argparse`
- Custom class to manage a bank account (OOP)
- Create a Python decorator from scratch
- Implement mini multithreaded downloader
